# Vapi4k Overview

We are big fans of [Vapi](https://vapi.ai). It is a great platform for building conversational AI applications.
We also love [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [Ktor](https://ktor.io) and believe they are excellent tools.

[Vapi4k](https://github.com/vapi4k/vapi4k) is a [Ktor](https://ktor.io) plugin and
a [Kotlin DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html)
that makes it easy to define, deploy, and maintain Vapi applications.

Vapi4k allows you to stop wrangling with Vapi REST calls, worrying about hand-coding Vapi JSON messages,
and implementing LLM tool calls.
Instead, Vapi4k allows you to focus on creating the prompts to build your voice application.

Vapi4k requires knowledge of the [Vapi API](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant)
and familiarity with Kotlin and Ktor. If you are new to Kotlin, you can learn more about
it [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html). It is a very easy
language to learn and is a great choice for server-side development. If you are comfortable with JavaScript, Python, or
Java, you will find Kotlin very easy to pick up.

Vapi4k is a work in progress. We are actively developing it and would love to hear your feedback.
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us at

If you follow the [Setup](https://vapi4k.com/setup.html) guide, you should
be up and running with an example application in less than 15 minutes.

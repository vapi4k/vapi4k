  For `endCall`, `transferCall`, and `dtmf` tools, this is auto-filled based on tool-specific fields like tool.destinations.
  But, even in those cases, you can provide a custom function definition for advanced use cases.
  An example of an advanced use case is if you want to customize the message that's spoken for `endCall` tool. You can
  specify a function where it returns an argument "reason". Then, in `messages` array, you can have many
  "request-complete" messages. One of these messages will be triggered if the `messages[].conditions` matches
  the "reason" argument.

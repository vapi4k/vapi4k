/**
These are the settings to configure or disable voicemail detection. Alternatively, voicemail detection can be configured
using the model.tools=[VoicemailTool]. This uses Twilio's built-in detection while the VoicemailTool relies on the model
to detect if a voicemail was reached. You can use neither of them, one of them, or both of them. By default, Twilio
built-in detection is enabled while VoicemailTool is not.

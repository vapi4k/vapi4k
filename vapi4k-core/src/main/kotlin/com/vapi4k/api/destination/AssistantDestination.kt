  <p>This is the mode to use for the transfer. Default is <code>rolling-history</code>.
  <ul><li><code>rolling-history</code>: This is the default mode. It keeps the entire conversation history and appends the new assistant's system message on transfer.
  Example:
  Pre-transfer: system: assistant1 system message assistant: assistant1 first message user: hey, good morning assistant: how can I help? user: I need help with my account assistant: (destination.message)
  Post-transfer: system: assistant1 system message assistant: assistant1 first message user: hey, good morning assistant: how can I help? user: I need help with my account assistant: (destination.message) system: assistant2 system message assistant: assistant2 first message (or model generated if firstMessageMode is set to assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message)
  <li><code>swap-system-message-in-history</code>: This replaces the original system message with the new assistant's system message on transfer.
  Example:
  Pre-transfer: system: assistant1 system message assistant: assistant1 first message user: hey, good morning assistant: how can I help? user: I need help with my account assistant: (destination.message)
  Post-transfer: system: assistant2 system message assistant: assistant1 first message user: hey, good morning assistant: how can I help? user: I need help with my account assistant: (destination.message) assistant: assistant2 first message (or model generated if firstMessageMode is set to <code>assistant-speaks-first-with-model-generated-message</code>)
